## Getting started

To start playing with the security service you need:

1. The internet connection (only to pull docker images from dockerhub)
2. Installed docker and docker-compose (optional but it will save you a lot of time)

After that please follow steps:

1. Create a catalog where we will be playing with the security service:

```
mkdir security-service-playground
```

2. Go to the catalog:

```
cd security-service-playground
```

3. Create docker-compose.yml:

```
touch docker-compose.yml
```

4. Open docker-compose.yml:

```
 open -e docker-compose.yml
```

5. Copy and paste the example from **Working example docker-compose.yaml** save the file
6. Run docker-compose:

```
 docker-compose up
```

Now you can go to http://localhost:50050/api-docs/#/ and play with security.

Mostly all of the endpoints are secured and you need to provide JWT token to use them. So firstly you need to use login endpoint to receive JWT token. After that insert token to padlock icon (only token without Bearer part) and click login.

Or you can open the admin panel that is a separate service (go to http://localhost:9000/) and log in with default credentials: superadmin, superadmin (remember to change this defaults when you will be using the security service on production)

## Working example docker-compose.yaml

```
version: "3.7"

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:10-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_USERNAME: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: users
    networks:
      - app

  redis:
    image: redis:4-alpine
    hostname: redis
    networks:
      - app

  security:
    image: tshio/security:0.0.46
    working_dir: /app/build/services/security
    command: api
    hostname: security
    volumes:
      - ./init-data-volume/:/app/services/security/init-data-volume
    environment:
      REACT_APP_SECURITY_API_URL: "http://localhost:50050"
    ports:
      - "50050:50050"

    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - redis
    networks:
      - app

  security-panel:
    image: tshio/rad-admin:0.0.3
    environment:
      REACT_APP_SECURITY_API_URL: "http://localhost:50050"
    ports:
      - 9000:80
    networks:
      - app
